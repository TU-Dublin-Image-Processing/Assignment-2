# CANCER SCREENING
In the process of isolating cancer cells from normal cells, cytotechnologists cannot be beaten. Their experience and understanding of cytology have yet to be overtaken by AI. However, image processors can still offer them a helping hand by allowing a cell of interest to be isolated from a cluster of cells and enhanced, resized, etc. for further investigation.   

Use your image processing skills to extract a user-selected cell from a microscopy image.

## Tips (not required):

* Start with ‘Cervical Colour.jpg’ as an easier task, then tackle ‘Cervical Mono.jpg’.
* Investigate the area around the click location to define the cell.
* Process the image to accentuate the cell or boundary of the cell.
* Use segmentation masking to isolate the selected cell, leaving the rest of the image blacked out.
* Crop, enhance and resize this image to give a final image of the cell of interest.


## Design Specifications:

* Give clear instructions to the user and capture their mouse-click on the cell of interest.
* Your final design should be a single file, which, when run, should allow cell extraction from any cellular microscopy image where individual cells can be visually distinguished.
* Your user interface should be simple and should output a single image. 
*Refer to the General Assignment Guidelines to maximise your marks.

As with anything you submit, this must be your own work and as such, it must not be similar to any other work, including other students' submissions, previous years' submissions or material found online. **Any excessively similar submission will receive a zero mark.**
